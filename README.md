# odin-landing-page

This is a landing page project from The Odin Project (OTP). It is a complete and simple website.

In this project I will be exploring all the HTML elements and CSS properties that I've learned inside and outside The Odin Project.

My main goal here is to try at least pixel perfect the design provided by The Odin Project (OTP) and try to make the page responsive as much as possible in any device browser (e.g.: Mobile and Tablet Browser) using Google Chrome browser tools.

I've learned another CSS properties in this project which is the CSS media. It helps me to set all the browser sizes to make a change with all the flexbox that I used. Now the webiste is responsive in any browser.

Credits to the owner of all the Images I used to complete and make this website more beautiful!
