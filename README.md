# odin-landing-page

This is a landing page project from The Odin Project (OTP). It is a complete and simple website.

In this project I will be exploring all the HTML elements and CSS properties that I've learned inside and outside The Odin Project.

My main goal here is to try at least pixel perfect the design provided by The Odin Project (OTP) and try to make the page responsive in any device browser (e.g.: Mobile and Tablet Browser) using Google Chrome browser tools.
